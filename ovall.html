    <h3> Introduction </h3>
    <p>OMINAS is an IDL-based software environment for the reduction and
      analysis of data taken by any space-based or Earth-based system.
      It was written by Joseph Spitale (jnspitale@psi.edu) under the
      direction of Carolyn Porco. Other contributers include Vance
      Haemmerle, Matthew Tiscareno, John Weiss, and Daiana DiNino.
      Funding for its initial development was provided through the
      Cassini mission. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Functional requirements</h1>
    <p>OMINAS development is guided by the following functional
      requirements: </p>
    <ul>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>
        <li>Portability </li>
      </h4>
      <p>OMINAS should operate on as many UNIX-based platforms as
        possible. This requirement is easily (though not trivially) met
        using IDL. To date, OMINAS has been tested on Alpha/OSF,
        Sun/Solaris, PC/Linux, and Mac/OS X. However, note that a
        specific OMINAS configuration (see Architecture below) may
        contain platform dependencies.</p>
      Note that it is desirable for OMINAS to remain backward compatible
      to the earliest possible IDL version so that users are not forced
      to upgrade.
      <p> </p>
      <h4>
        <li>Speed</li>
      </h4>
      <p>OMINAS computational routines must be as fast as possible.
        Although this requirement is the most difficult to meet using
        IDL, through the use of massive array operations, every existing
        routine in OMINAS operates at an acceptable speed, usually
        comparable to analogous code written in C.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>
        <li>Modularity</li>
      </h4>
      <p>OMINAS obeys object-oriented software concepts, so that it is
        highly modular and relatively easy to modify. Although IDL
        directly provides for an object-oriented architecture, that
        packaged is not used in OMINAS, or reasons mainly having to do
        with flexibility</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>
        <li>Generality</li>
      </h4>
      <p>OMINAS itself must not contain any code that is dependent upon
        the particular instrument that generated the input data, or upon
        the organization of the file in which the data resides. Because
        IDL compiles code dynamically, this requirement is met in OMINAS
        by allowing for external "user"-written configuration code that
        contains all of the specifics of a particular data source.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>
        <li>Scripting</li>
      </h4>
      <p>OMINAS must maintain a lowest-level user interface that
        operates from a command line so that analyses may be constructed
        as command scripts. Such a capability is necessary in order for
        jobs to be performed in batch mode with no user intervention.
        Moreover, such a capability must not prevent the addition of a
        more user-friendly graphical interface. OMINAS contains a
        command level user interface known as <a
          href="./gen/nv/com/pg/topic.html">PG</a>, which consists of a
        number of IDL programs. Those programs may be combined into IDL
        batch files and run autonomously. There is also a graphical
        interface call <a href="./routines/grim.txt">GRIM</a>
        (GRaphical Interface to oMinas).</p>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <p>The following diagram illustrates the relationships among the
      various components of a OMINAS installation. </p>
    <p> <img src="arch.png" width="800"> </p>
    <p> The core OMINAS code is completely independent of the source of
      the data and the type of file in which it is stored. Those details
      are configured based on the intended purpose of a particular
      OMINAS installation. For example, the Cassini ISS installation
      contains configuration code that reads and writes VICAR image
      files and SPICE kernels. </p>
    <p> The separation between the data processing and I/O is maintained
      by a portion of the OMINAS system called NV. NV uses
      application-specific configuration tables to determine how to
      transform ancillary data from external sources into the standard
      data objects recognized in OMINAS. NV is described in detail in
      nv_description.txt.</p>
    <p> The OMINAS object library defines and manipulates the the basic
      data objects used to describe the various entities -- cameras,
      planets, rings, etc., -- of interest to the user. The object
      library is described in lib_description.txt.</p>
    <p> The typical OMINAS user will operate at the command level, which
      consists of the image display program <a
        href="./routines/tvim.txt">TVIM</a>, the NV I/O commands <a
        href="./routines/nv_read.txt">NV_READ</a> and <a
        href="./routines/nv_write.txt">NV_WRITE</a>, and a set of
      programs based on the underlying object library and utility
      routines referred to as <a href="./gen/nv/com/pg/topic.html">PG</a>.
    </p>
    <p> The graphical interface to OMINAS is called <a
        href="./routines/grim.txt">GRIM</a>. Although it's designed to
      be used along with the command line like a fancy TVIM, GRIM may be
      used on its own.</p>

      <h3>
        Installation
      </h3>


      </div>
 
<p>The full OMINAS package, including the default configuration, is stored  in a compressed tar file named ominas_1.0_all.tar.gz.  Data files and software 
packages used by specific translators (e.g., NAIFLIB, star catalogs, etc.) may need to be obtained and configured separately.  Follow this procedure to install the basic system:
</p>

 


<p>1) Create an appropriate top-level directory for OMINAS and put the tar file in
   that directory.</p>


<p>2) Unpack the source files by typing:</p>

<ul>
<p>   tar xvfz ominas_1.0_all.tar</p>
</ul>


<p>3) Configure and test your installation by following <a href="./configuration.html">these</a> instructions.</p>


      <h3>
        Configuring OMINAS
      </h3>

      </div>
 
<p>The most straightforward way to configure OMINAS is to use the C-shell configuration file, config/ominas_env.csh, provided with the distribution.  Copy that file to another location (like your home directory) and follow the instructions contained in the file. </p>

      <h3>
        Running OMINAS
      </h3>
      </div>
 
<p>OMINAS is a collection of IDL programs that may be called any time during an IDL session, provided OMINAS is properly installed.  The default command-level interface to OMINAS is called <a href="./gen/nv/com/pg/topic.html">PG</a>.   There is also a graphical interface called <a href="./routines/grim.txt">GRIM</a>.  The best way to get started with OMINAS is to look at the demo scripts located in demo/*.example.</p>
